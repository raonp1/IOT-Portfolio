          <h2>Technical Proficiency</h2>
          <h3>Exploring Documentation</h3>
          <p>GitLab is still not working we were able to view documentation, but not login. Think I have a slight
            understanding toward what technical tasks need to be done. I will be looking at the containers for the
            servers, which is why I was looking at the documentation for Docker. I am slowly trying to understand what
            it is that I need to do but I’m still not fully sure. In my own time I need to learn Docker but also Django
            as I was advised to. [maybe screenshot of joshes documentation]</p>
        </div>

        <h3>First Sprint</h3>
        <p>
          Today we started our first sprint and planned out what projects to do. After being assigned to a task
          I spent the rest of the class time trying to understand and as I call it “Unravelling my brain”. Although I
          don’t have a solid solution, I am sure I can easily find out so I am mostly confident. </p>

        <h3>Docker</h3>
        <p>
          I have been given some instructions on what it is I have to do. I created an ubuntu virtual machine and was
          given a good website known as tutorialpoint.com to learn docker from scratch. I had learnt Docker in the past
          but have forgot most of it unfortunately [show docker in vm]</p>

        <h3>Docker Cont.</h3>
        <p>
          I learnt the basics for docker up to the point of being able to make a web app. [find early docker
          screenshots] Bex (also in the IOT team) made me realise that I needed to use a server. So I am thinking about
          creating a server.</p>

        <h3>Alternative Method</h3>
        <p>
          Henry (former IOT student) showed me a web app he had pulled down from someones github. He had given me
          instructions on how to install this and use it. Not realising at the time, I fully followed his instruction
          including instaling a type of docker [find the name]. I already had docker on my vm so it showed errors as it
          was trying to run two types of docker at once. I thought it would be a good idea to just delete docker and
          reinstall, doing this broke my ingest webapp. So I learnt the hard way to be more careful with what I deleted
          on the vm. I am going to start again in a fresh new server. [I should try finding old docker]</p>

          <h2>Professional proficiency</h2>
          <h3>Start</h3>
          <p>We just had a meeting covering a basic introduction to the other members and learnt about what the Internet
            of Things is. Martin (our lecturer/supervisor) explained the basic theory and talked about current client
            projects such as Orokonui. Unfortunately, GitLab is down so we are limited to what we can do. So it was
            purely an observational session. [ask henry for photo of whiteboard]</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Webex Meetings</h3>
        <p>Due to the whole covid outbreak, we are now forced to comunicate online and have our classes/meetings online.
          This made it difficult for us to comunicate and get needed help. ....(come back to this)</p>

        <h3>Team Communication and Scrum meetings</h3>
        <p>It has been hard trying to get help while being stuck at home, I was asking Martin for help but also trying
          not to bombard him with questions as he is a busy man and I'm not the only one who needs his help. In our
          meeting today, Martin advised us to comunicate with each other (as in the team) more. Our teams chat is not as
          active as it should be. We all agreed with Martin and created a seperate IOT team group [screen shot of the
          chat]. Me and Bex decided to work together via discord video chat. One of us would screen share and the other
          would help. [get on call with bex and ask for screen shot] I have said that I would be scrum master for a few
          weeks now but did not know the role and the importance of the role. I knew I had to lead the meeting but did
          not know how and felt very uncomfortable. Martin told me to mkae sure I do some reasearch before I lead the
          next scrum.</p>

        <h3>Scrum Master</h3>
        <p>In order to understand the role of scrum master, I went back and did some revision on Agile and scrums in
          general first. I then went on understand the roles in agile and what each role has to do. I continued to
          learnt about the dos and don'ts of a Scrum Master and watch examples of a Scrum Master in meetings. [show
          roles diagram (add: after seeing this diagram it clicked), what I read and videos I watched (maybe embedd the
          video)]. I aksed Bee (project lead) for some advice on leading, she gave me a lot of help especially about
          being a Scrum Master. [ask bee if ok to snip messages she sent] The time has come for our next meeting, I am
          super nervous. I had prepared notes about what to say and do. I kept it kept the meeting agile and focused on
          three things. 1. What did you do yesterday 2. What are you going to 3. Are there any obstacles and ask if they
          needed help, I would finish the scrum by passing the meeting on to Martin. [Maybe turn this into a list] This
          was actually harder than I thought and I actually missed one member of our IOT group, it is not easy for me to
          lead and take on others responsibilities. However, being a Scrum Master made me pay more attention for what my
          team members are working on.[take photo of my notes] My role as a Scrum Master was not limited to just the
          meetings, I knew that I needed to put the team before me so I messaged all of my team mates and asked them if
          everything is okay and how their project is going and offer help. [not sure if taking snip is ok here]</p>
