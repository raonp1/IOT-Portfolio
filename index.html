    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>Today was day one of project. Adon gave a presentation about project, it was an introduction to the projects and
        lecturer. We firstly had to setup a computer and then all sat down. At this current stage all project students
        are still choosing their projects for the semester. I’m most likely going to be in Operations and Security again
        for my project 1. The only tasks we have been given were the following three shown:</p>

    <p>Day two, thought I was going to be back in Ops & Sec but that is full so now I am part of IOT (as ops…I think).
        We just had a basic introduction to the other members and learnt about what the Internet of Things is. Martin
        (our lecturer/supervisor) explained the basic theory and talked about current client projects such as Orokonui.
        Unfortunately, GitLab is down so we are limited to what we can do.

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>Day three and GitLab is still not working we were able to view documentation, but not login. I think I will be
        looking at the containers for the servers, which is why I was looking at the documentation for Docker. I am
        slowly trying to understand what it is that I need to do but I’m still not fully sure. In my own time I need to
        learn Docker but also Django as I was advised to.

    <p>Day four, this is our first session with GitLab back and our first sprint too. Today has been more of an
        assigning type of session. We are now actually planning out what projects to do. After being assigned to a task
        I spent the rest of the class time trying to understand and as I call it “Unravelling my brain”. Although I
        don’t have a solid solution, I am sure I can easily find out so I am mostly confident. </p>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <p>Day before five, yes I came into Polytech on a Sunday. But I wanted to have something to show …. [talk about the
        docker I learnt and how bex made me realise I should be doing it on a server…or maybe not talk about that IDK]
